			<h1>Element Cycles</h1>
			<p>One of the most important parts of the Five Element Theory is the relationship between the different elements. This is described by the two cycles in which the elements are placed. The idea behind these cycles is that every element is related to the others in some way which also explains their position over or below another element. For instance we know that water is stronger than fire as it puts fire out, this is explained in the Ke or Control Cycle of the Five Element Theory.</p>
			<p>Both these cycles help to produce patterns which can be found constantly throughout the world. And if you look deeper you can find even more interesting relationship between the elements by working with not just one but both of the cycles at the same time.</p>
			
			<h2>Generating Cycle</h2>
			<img src="../images/sheng_cycle.gif" alt="Image depicting the sheng cycle of the five elements" class="cycle_img" />
			<p>The Sheng or Generating Cycle is all about the production of the elements and the natural flow of energy from one form into another. The important thing to grasp here is the fact that increase or decrease in one element completely effects the production of all other elements. This is often used when looking at medical issues like whether your liver is working hard enough or if there is too much blood circulating in the body.</p>
			<p>An easy way to look at this cycle is through the story that it tells. Let's start with the element of water. Water is followed in the cycle by wood and this is because trees grow when they gain nutrients from water. Without water a tree cannot exist and as a tree grows it consumes water, thus water generates wood. Following wood is fire, this is because fire needs fuel to burn and the most abundant fuel is wood. Without wood there would be no fire and thus wood generates fire.</p>
			<p>After fire comes earth. Fire produces ash the remnants of the burned up wood which is returns to the land and becomes part of the earth. This creation of ash by fire is the generation of earth and new soil. Earth is filled and made up of many minerals and some of those cane form into metal. The more earth there is the greater chance you can find metal within it. So following earth is the element of metal. Often it can be found that water droplets condense and form on metal for it can cool the air. This shows the way in which metal can generate water.</p>
			
			<h2>Control Cycle</h2>
			<img src="../images/ke_cycle.gif" alt="Image depicting the ke cycle of the five elements" class="cycle_img" />
			<p>The Ke or Control Cycle is all about the control one element has over another element. This is described in a way to show that the elements can do more than just flow into one another but can also clash and overcome one another. This cycle is related to the generating cycle but in an interesting way which takes some thought into how it actually controls the element based on the cycle.</p>
			<p>To start we can look at the relationship between fire and water. It is easy to see why water controls fire, it is due to the way water can put out fire. Relating to the generation cycle we can also see that fire eventually leads to the creation of more water, which if it isn't used to produce wood will prevent the fire from sustaining itself. Now we have seen not only that the control cycle is logical, but how the generating cycle interrelates with it.</p>
			<p>As for the rest of the elements we can see that fire has control over metal because it is with fire that we shape and forge metal. Sometimes fire is even used to extract the metal from earth to begin with. Metal then has control over wood, this is seen in the classic scene of chopping down a tree with an ax. The metal tool is strong enough to overcome the power of wood. Wood has control over the earth. We can find evidence of this at the base of trees. Tree roots trap the earth and prevent it from blowing away in the wind. And Earth has control over water for the rivers of the world are formed because of the way the earth is shaped.</p>
