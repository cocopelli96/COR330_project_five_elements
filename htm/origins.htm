			<h1>Origins in Dao</h1>
			
			<div class="img-container col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
				<img src="../images/yin_yang.jpg" alt="image of yin and yang with the dragon and tiger representation" class="col-sm-12 col-xs-6" />
			</div>
			
			<p>The true beginnings of this theory came from the beliefs of Daoism and over time spread through all of China. It all begins with the concept of yin and yang. This is the belief in a duality which can classify and explain the world. It also goes deeper though, yin and yang are not merely a system of classification but also a system of balance<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">3</a></sup>. There is a deep held belief in Chinese philosophy which looks to produce balance not only in oneself but in the universe as a whole.</p>
			<p>From yin and yang grew the concept of the five elements or five phases. These were fire, earth, metal, water, and wood which created a balance in the universe. The idea being that metal represented as the tiger is aligned with the concept of yin, while wood being represented as the dragon is aligned with the concept of yang. Fire, water, and earth stand between both yin and yang creating there own spectrum where earth becomes the true neutral and with fire and water on opposite ends. This produced a new way of describing the world and looking at balance.</p>
			<p>Like yin and yang people could classify different parts of the world under these different elements. This came from the deep held belief of where the elements came from. In Daoism it was believed that when the heaven and earth split it created the elements and the five primordial gods that represented them<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">9</a></sup>. Not only that, but the Chinese had found that the pattern of five was repeated through the world: five planets visible in the sky, five inner organs of the human body, five sacred mountains of China<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">9</a></sup>. These beliefs shaped the view of the five elements and how they could be used to explain the world.</p>
			<p>The primordial gods were also depicted in very different ways. Sometimes each of the gods rode a mighty dragon and sometimes the dragons were the gods<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">9</a></sup>. The people of China also gave each of the gods many names and the served different functions<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">9</a></sup>. In this way the gods themselves seemed to reflect the ideas of the Five Element Theory as they themselves seemed to be collections of beliefs and values.</p>
			
			<h2>Wu Xing</h2>
			<p>The original Chinese term for the Five Element Theory was <span class="font-italic">Wu Xing</span> which more accurately translates to "Five Phases"<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>. This is because <span class="font-italic">Wu</span> is the Chinese word for "five" and <span class="font-italic">Xing</span> is a word meaning "walk" or "move"<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>. This leads to the idea that these are not five elements but rather five phases, because the term refers to motion. However, due to poor translation it eventually became known as the Five Element Theory outside of China<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>Looking at the Five Element Theory as the Five Phases Theory actually makes it easier to understand the system as a whole. When we look at the system as if it were elements we might feel that everything is distinct or made up of separate things. It then becomes hard to conceptualize the idea of listing things as corresponding to elements. Just try to explain we the taste bitter is associated with fire, why the color black is paired with water, and why the lungs are part of the wood element. It is hard to make sense of many of these decisions without already knowing where they belong.</p>
			<p>If we image the system as a set of phases, where everything follows a cycle and flows from one to another, it becomes easier to understand the process of classification. It is the same way the energy and fluids in the body pass from one organ to another or how the seasons continually change. In this way you only need to determine the cycle of what you are trying to classify, because now everything fits into place as soon as you find one pairing. You can also relate items to the different concepts behind a phase which makes them easier to understand. This might be like saying that sweetness is classified as earth because of the bounty you can sow from the earth or that bitterness is a item of fire because bitter tastes can cause a burning like sensation in the body<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">4</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>It also helps to understand that while the concept of yin and yang aligns with Wu Xing it also does not align with Wu Xing<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>. This is because yin and yang look at the world at a higher level than Wu Xing does. Wu Xing focuses more on a harmony based in the relationship of different parts of the world, it is not a cut and dry duality like yin and yang. The harmony of yin and yang is found through balancing the two, while the balance of Wu Xing is found through allowing energy to flow from one phase to another. This is why yin might be related to metal, metal and water, or wood and yang might be related to wood, wood and fire, or metal<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>. There is a disconnect at times when people try to think of which phases relate to yin and yang because while the two systems are similar and can be linked together, they look at the world differently and do not always agree with one another<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">5</a></sup>.</p>
			
			<h2>Spread of the Five Elements</h2>
			<p>As the concept of the five elements spread it was adopted by Confucian thought. Confucianism focused on the practice of balancing the world using the five elements<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">3</a></sup>. This led to its use in medicine, nutrition, agriculture, art, and literature<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">3</a></sup>. This practice was about harmony both finding it and helping to create it. The theory was also used to explain the transition of dynasties through history in China and as part of the astrological system<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. Fung Shui also makes reference to the Five Element Theory in its attempts to manipulate qi.</p>
			<p>Though the theory did not penetrate all parts of Chinese belief. Buddhism had its own concept of the elements and so never adopted the Five Element Theory<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">7</a></sup>. Buddhism used a four element system with fire, water, air, and earth. Like the Five Element Theory these were sometimes viewed as a cycle, but unlike the theory they were never used to try and classify the world.</p>
