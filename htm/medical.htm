			<h1>Medicine Practices</h1>
			
			<h2>Western Models of Medicine</h2>
			<p>Today Western medicine is managed by a belief in science. Science is the system which is used to explain every illness a person can get and how to cure that illness. This is how we decide to care for our bodies based on the world view that we currently share. Any other world view such as an element theory might seem more like magic or a primitive and unhelpful method of medicine.</p>
			<p>What is interesting about such a belief is that the West has not always believed in science. In fact during the medieval ages Europe used a system called the Four Humors to examine the body and treat various illnesses. The Four Humors was in all retrospect an element theory which believed illness were caused by an imbalance of fluids in the body. Each of these fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) was related to and element (fire, water, air, and earth).</p>
			<p>Now through a lens of science today we call the practices and medical treatments of the past barbaric in nature. This is because through the system of the Four Humors it might be found that you have too much blood in the body. In such a case the doctor would bleed you in order to rid the body of excess blood. However, this led to many deaths for reason such as area not being sanitary and that bleeding in this way cause infections. Science however, would not have come to such a conclusion because it views illness in a different way.</p>
			
			<h2>Chinese Traditional Medicine</h2>
			<p>One form of Chinese traditional medicine uses the Five Element Theory. This theory looks at the body as a complex world with many relationship that work under the same premise as the cycle of the five elements. In this system a relationship between organs might be viewed like this: the liver controls the spleen and so too much action in the liver can restrain the spleen and cause an imbalance. To fix illness in the Five Element Theory it is important to fix the balance of the elements in the body. This can be done in different ways from eating more foods that contain the need element or doing activities that might expend the harmful element.</p>
			<p>Another important idea of using the Five Element Theory in medicine is that because everything in the body is related the effects of a disease or imbalance will be easy to spot. This is due to the way that the body replicates the theory over and over within itself. Not only are the heart, spleen, liver, lungs, and kidney a representation of the cycle but so are the five senses and the small intestine, gall, bladder, stomach, and large intestine. So a disease that is effecting the body specifically in a certain organ might also be visible due to a person's emotional state or the sense organs like the eyes.</p>
			<p>The use of the Five Element Theory in medicine is complex because it is in a way open to interpretation. Not all practitioners will agree on the same cause of an illness or even the same way to cure the illness. This is because the system is inductive only to a point and after that it becomes deduction and speculation. In a way this is similar to doctors of Western medicine because they must be trained in the system for their to even be a hope that they might agree on the cause of the illness or a cure. And even then not all Western doctors will agree either.</p>
