			<h1>The Succession of Dynasties</h1>
			
			<h2>Cultural Context</h2>
			<p>Before looking at the succession of dynasties through the lens of the Five Element Theory we must first understand how the Chinese look at history. In the West, countries and people tend to see time as a series of linear events in which you are traveling from the left (the past) to the right (the future). In this model it is evident that the belief is that society is always progressing and that newer empires, kingdoms, and nations are always better than the older ones.</p>
			<p>This can lead to different problems about how you view history. In this way you can look at history as the road you took to get to the future and you might learn from past mistakes. In this way you will not repeat history and continue in forward progression. But you might also ignore past events because they will never be as good as the present and future. In this way you might believe that the past has nothing to teach us and possibly doom yourself to the same old mistakes.</p>
			<p>China however, views the progression of time in a very different way. China views time as traveling from the top (the past) to the bottom (the future) in a spiraling motion. This falling motion shows us that China believes that the past was the greatest humanity ever was or will be, the ultimate goal would be to go back to how things were in the past but we will never be able to reach this point. Time also follows a spiral which means they believe that time repeats itself and you can learn from history to predict what will happen next.</p>
			<p>The way China views time as cyclical in nature aligns perfectly with the concept of the Five Element Theory, because the Five Element Theory is about the cycle of energy that is present throughout the world. In this way China can overlay this theory and time to find ways to predict future events, how best to solve problems, and even to map what parts of time were better than other parts of times.</p>
			
			<h2>Dynasties</h2>
			<p>Dynasties in China often represented themselves with different colors and symbols than other dynasties. Every time a dynasty took power from another they needed to try and prove that they had the divine right to take power and run the country. The use of the Five Element Theory to explain dynastic succesion was first introduced in the Qin Dynasty about 221 BCE<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. When the Western Han Dynasty succeeded the Qin Dynasty in 206 BCE this model became the main method of explaining dynastic succession with the Mandate of Heaven<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>The use of the Five Element Theory meant that a Dynasty would designate itself as representing an element and use colors and symbols related to that element. They often went in order of the generating cycle, so an earth dynasty would be succeeded by a metal dynasty which would be succeeded by a water dynasty<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. However, there were also times when the succession was based upon the control cycle, most often when the dynasty felt they were enemies of the former dynasty or that the former was not a true Chinese dynasty<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. In this way a metal dynasty might be succeeded by a fire dynasty. And there were times when entire sets of dynasties were excluded<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. In this way a dynasty of metal might succeed a dynasty of water because they have excluded the two previous dynasties (metal and water) from their dynastic lineage.</p>
			<p>Some dynasties took a long time to decide which element they wanted to use as their representation. Advisors might disagree with one another because of many different reasons<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. These might be based on whether they conquered the last dynasty or even if they felt the were succeeding a different earlier dynasty. And sometimes a dynasty might not annouce what they believed their element to be, which leads to other dynasties and scholars applying an element to them<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>This system of defining dynastic succession ended with the rise of the Qing Dynasty<sup><a href="../htm/bibliography.htm">1</a></sup>. This was due to the fact that the system had become too complex. It was hard to track a dynastic lineage as some dynasties had excluded others while more dynasties conquered others. Because of this the Qing Dynasty did away with the system referring only to the Mandate of Heaven for their right to rule China.</p>
			
			<h2>Case Study</h2>
			<p>Yuan Cheng's paper "Legitimation Discourse and the Theory of the Five Elements in Imperial China" gives good examples of some of the uses of the Five Element Theory in dynastic succession. One important section of this paper looks at the dynasties which directly followed the Tang Dynasty. These dynasties didn't follow the succession pattern of dynasties in the normal cycle of the Five Element Theory. Instead these dynasties would excluded "illegitimate" dynasties which effected which elements they claimed as their own. However, though this didn't follow the normal flow of the element cycle they still maintained and used the Five Element Theory inorder to legitimize their rule.</p>
			<p>The Tang Dynasty was of the element of earth. This dynasty had been succeed by the Later Liang Dynasty which invoked the element of metal to prove they were the legitimate heirs to China, because metal comes after the element of earth in the cycle. However, the Later Tang Dynasty felt that the Later Liang Dynasty was not legitimate and so did not claim the element of water to follow them. Instead the Later Tang Dynasty felt they were a continuation of the Tang Dynasty and chose to use the element of earth to prove this fact. Dynasties that followed the Later Tang Dynasty followed in their predecessor's foot steps and so the next element was dynasty element was metal which would be expected.</p>
