			<h1>China's Five Element Theory</h1>
			
			<p>Summer, the bitter taste of a medical herb, the heart, Mars floating round the Earth, and the color red. What do all of these have in common? They are all classified under the element of fire using China's Five Element Theory. This theory is based on traditional Daoist ideas and has evolved through the years to be used for many different purposes. The whole concept of the Five Element Theory is a way describe the universe and how everything interacts. It is a cosmology with the purpose to show both the balance of the world and the five phases that all energy cycles through. This is not the only theory that has been used to describe the world in such ways and is only one of many used by different cultures and religions throughout the world.</p>
			<p>The importance of theories like this are that they shape a world view at the fundamental level. When you believe that there is a balance to the world you view imperfections in the world as unbalanced parts of the equation. In this way you can view the world as either heading towards and attempting to be balanced or heading away from being balanced. The same as the scientific idea of entropy, a theory stating that the universe is continually heading towards chaos. Thoughts like this change how you look at making the world. And if you were trying to make it better, instead of advancing knowledge you might try to fix the balance of the world or even in yourself.</p>
			<p>Other cultures have had similar theories to that of the five elements but none go as far in the classification of the universe. Medieval Europe had a concept of the four humors which created a balance in the body based off of the four elements<sup><a href="./htm/bibliography.htm">7</a></sup>. It was used to treat people medically and led to the practice of bleeding people out as a health benefit. Buddhism has a concept of four elements and balance between them which helps create a nurtured soul<sup><a href="./htm/bibliography.htm">7</a></sup>. Ancient India believed that five elements created and made up everything in the universe<sup><a href="./htm/bibliography.htm">7</a></sup>. Even the scientific concept of atoms in a way is related.<p>
			<p>What is important about each of these theories is how they shape the way we view the world. It is not as simple to think that they have no effect on our beliefs. When science views the world as being made up of atoms it tells us that the world is a like a lego set. Even further it explains that we are very fortunate that the builder of our world put everything together the way they did. But with the five elements we view the world as a set of phases. Everything passes from one phase into another according to the flow of the elements. We might get stuck and hindered in one phase and this produces an imbalance, but in the end we always move on. These differences in thought appear not just in how we view the world but in all aspects of our life from medicine to education to expressions in our common vocabulary.</p>
			<p>Only when we have learned about the system another culture uses to view the world can we truly begin to understand how we view the world now. Learning about the Five Element Theory of China my help to show so of these insights into Western thought as well. This site is devoted to the explanation of the Five Element Theory in order to further not only an understanding of Chinese culture and how they view the world, but also the Western culture in which we live.</p>
